# Victories

Good job on having these below :)

It's important to remember that it's not about how often or do numbers change, gaps etc. It's just about each of these are great and appreciated, you are better because of these.

All of these are steps that take you forward!

And don't worry about mundane or trivial, it all matters and having a long list is always better than a short one. Don't downplay all the little things you do (and keep it private from others if you wish, but at the very least don't push yourself down)

- Well I wrote this

- And I hung out with a bunch of my friends today

- I ate smallish lunches and dinners - not a lot but progress - soda helps when I don't want to eat as much

- Brain dumped several pages 

- New pen refill
 
- And now improving this script. Too bad some of my test data won't be here as much but whatever.

- Added more fixes to this client feels even better

- I was able to send in a DEVELOPMENT.md and PROPOSAL.md, yes just minutes around the deadline but whatever. 

- Also I actually got snake to work with OpenFrameword other help was helpful and it worked with my sorta incomplete LinkedList so this was also a cs126 success in my books

- Spent a lot of time thinking about my goals and such, ideas are flowing

- More time on realizing what my priorities are and what matters to me. It's good that I'm starting to figure this out

- Had a nice convo with apple on the freelancing side - the idea is planted now 

- Jacquio also made me realize some things and had a nice wholesome convo. 

- Cleaned up and made more changes to this script. See I'm okay with just spamming and overdoing wholesomeness xD maybe this gets old soon but how much ever it works just go for it :)
