# Victories

Good job on having these below :)

It's important to remember that it's not about how often or do numbers change, gaps etc. It's just about each of these are great and appreciated, you are better because of these.

All of these are steps that take you forward!

And don't worry about mundane or trivial, it all matters and having a long list is always better than a short one. Don't downplay all the little things you do (and keep it private from others if you wish, but at the very least don't push yourself down)
